The scope of Budget Buddy is a very clear philosophy – “data for your
decisions.” The app will be an objective presentation of facts with no 
intention of preaching any financial philosophy to the user. Our scope is to
provide data that helps the user make decisions on their own. Given this clear
distinction, Budget Buddy’s scope begins with a financial profile, expense 
tracking, and visual decision-making and stops at investment advice, product
promotion, or alternative budgeting decisions.
